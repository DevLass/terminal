<h3 align="justify"> <i>So normally I have a lot to say about my project, but this one is really very simple, It works by reading input's and responses to that command.<br><br>
Its biggest difference in relation to my other projects is the HTML semantics that I improved a lot. I took some time to learn the importance of main, section, header and footer <br> <br> I intend to study more about SEO in the future, and maybe bring an article about what I learn here, I also intend to add more commands and interactions to this terminal. Your ideas are welcome!!</i> </h3>
