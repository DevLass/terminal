<h3 align="justify"> <i>This was a request from a great friend, so I think it's fair to put the specs requested by him here. He wanted something that would choose for us the characters we would use in a game. As not all characters work together the pick list would have to be closed. It's a simple project, but I got a snack for it ;p<br><br>
All the HTML and CSS of this project are very simple, however it is completely responsive, both for desktop and mobile. It's also the first project I commented on by git, so we have a lot of news. <br><br> The JavaScript of this project is also very simple, everything works based on the function template below.</i> </h3>

<h3 align="justify"><i>With a local image bank, we have a total of 30 options, we have this flip animation with <a href="https://animista.net/play/basic/rotate">Animista </a> and also an audio synchronized with the flip of the button (It's simple but it's the first time I work with it)<br><br> One thing to improve is to remove the local image bank and put it in the cloud or use it directly from the RIOT API <br><br> Lastly, this project is on github pages  <a href="https://italicnich.github.io/lol-duo/">Lol - Random Duo</a> I hope you enjoy :D</i></h3>
